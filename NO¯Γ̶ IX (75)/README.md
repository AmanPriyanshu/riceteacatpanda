I can't seem to figure out this broken equation... a lot seems to be missing... the author said that

`meow = Totally [Chall Title]`

`100-hex(meow)=flag!`

Hints
-------------------------------------------
-  put in the flag format: `rtcp{[hex humber]}` or as just the hex: `[hex number]`

- the flag is positive
