Snakes

♪ Should've known,
Should've known,
Should've known,
Should've known -

Snakes don't have no shoulders to lean on

They just need a prey they can feed on

They get some points so they can drag them home

*original cold-blood killer*

*never knew something so wicked*, oh

Come and get your points where they aren't supposed to go. ♪
