print(f) to Pay Respects
-------------------------------------------

Lulu recently began to collect rice granules, she needs so many! (like over 9999) Jake says it might be a cure to Lulu's disease. Go help her get enough by throwing rice at the portal, print(f) to pay respects.

Hints
-------------------------------------------
- Careful not to throw rice in the wrong direction, just thow it close by (not into) the portal - Jake can pick it up later.
