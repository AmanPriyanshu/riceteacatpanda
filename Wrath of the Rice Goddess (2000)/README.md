Hints
-------------------------------------------
- Data linearization and generalization tend to make a lot of things lead to Rome.
  ... or I think that's how the saying goes

- Python is more or less required for this. Try making a byte encoder!

- I would try sweet-talking the panda, maybe start with something like `I love rice, tea, cats, and pandas`

- Never, **EVER** trust the developer. (but do trust this hint)
