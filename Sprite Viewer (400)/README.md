Sprite Viewer
-------------------------------------------

The developer of that work in progress game thinks there may have been a bug on his end, and has asked us to get the md5 hash of the goblin sprite image.

Here's the place where he got the images... but... they're stuck in a web player!!! How will you get the hash out of that?!
