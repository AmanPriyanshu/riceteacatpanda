# RiceTeaCatPanda

RiceTeaCatPanda is a CTF (Capture The Flag competition) that crosses a variety of random ideas and challenges to solve, including but not limited to cryptography, web, binary, forensics, general computer skills, data analysis, and AI exploitation!

This repo contains all the challenges listed on [`riceteacatpanda.wtf`](riceteacatpanda.wtf). When the challenges and website are finally taken down, all files and programs will also be listed here, along with the developer writeups.
