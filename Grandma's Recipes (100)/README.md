Grandma's Recipes
-------------------------------------------

So Delphine and the GIANt wanted to make a recipe that Delphine's grandma passed down to her. The problem is, her grandma is extremely tech-savvy. In fact, she likes using a Certain Website on the endless Inter-Webs. She says it's very useful for storing her recipes. It'll be kinda hard for Delphine and the GIANt to git her recipes though; they don't know her username. Oh well. But hey, they know that she likes naming things after the Holy Rice Goddess.

I wonder what recipe Delphine and GIANt are making...
